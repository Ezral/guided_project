    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Apparently for this project our service is needed to create the logical core of an app which calculate probabilities for lottery addicts to better estimate their chances of winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "A medical institution recognizes that compulsive gambling or gambling addiction, particularly lottery gambling, is increasing and has reached to a point where some would engage in criminal offense to fund their lottery adventure. To help tackle this issue, the said institution plans to create a mobile app that helps lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. \n",
    "\n",
    "The intention for the first version of the app is to answer the following questions  \n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "- What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "And for this purpose we are requested to consider historical data coming from the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada. \n",
    "<sub>  Because there are plenty of lottery addicts there? This would be an interesting question to answer. Using data, of course.</sub>\n",
    "\n",
    "I included __DSM-5's__ (for informational purposes only) [gambling disorder diagnostic criteria](https://www.ncpgambling.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/DSM-5-Diagnostic-Criteria-Gambling-Disorder.pdf) that can be opened from the link so we can see what these lottery addicts symptoms are.<sub>  In case we're feeling curious. Personally, I wouldn't have thought that lottery would get to people as bad as horse/sport betting. To the point they would actually perform a property crime violation over lottery. Anyway... </sub>\n",

    "### Defining formula\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with writing a function to calculate factorial and combinations. For factorials, we will use the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$n! = n \\times (n-1) \\times (n-2) \\times ... \\times 2 \\times 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As for combinations, this following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\small n \\normalsize C \\small k \\normalsize = \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$\n",
    "\n",
